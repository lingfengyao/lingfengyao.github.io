Welcome! I am currently a graduate student in Computer Technology at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/)). My primary research interests focus lies in the field of **network security**, with a particular interest in **data-driven intrusion detection**. Specifically, I am exploring advanced techniques to address challenges such as **label noise**, **unknown traffic detection**, and **few-shot learning**.
