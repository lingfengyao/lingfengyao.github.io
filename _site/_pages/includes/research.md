**A Robust Malicious Traffic Detection Framework with Low-quality Labeled Data**

**Role:** Group leader


  - Proposed a novel double-constrained similarity rule to construct a similarity topology graph and utilized the topological relationships to refine the low-quality labels. 
    
  - Implemented the algorithm and evaluated the performance on BoT-IoT and a real-world malicious traffic dataset, achieving an accuracy of 90% with 80% noise labels.

  - ÔÇü	Summarized the ideas and experimental results, wrote a paper, and submitted it to ICC 2024.

**A Generic Framework to Enhance Model Robustness for Intrusion Detection on Noisy Data**
**Role:** Group leader



  - Proposed a generic label-noise-resistant framework for malicious traffic detection, which worked 
    significantly better compared to state-of-the-art methods (1.69% and 1.86% better than the 
    second-best algorithm and 20.86% and 12.61% better than the third-best algorithm).
    
  - Implemented the algorithm of Gedss and evaluated the performance on two popular datasets, i.e., BoT-IoT and CICIDS2017. The accuracy of Gedss achieves 96.08% and 96.22% for the two datasets with 80% noise labels.

  - Summarized the ideas and experimental results, wrote a paper, and submitted it to CSCWD 2024.

**Model-Agnostic Generation-Enhanced Technology for Few-Shot Intrusion Detection in IoT**
  
**Role:** Main developer


* Proposed a Model-Agnostic Generation-Enhanced Technology (MAGET) for few-shot intrusion 
  detection based on GAN and MAML, which improves the accuracy of identifying few-shot attacks on two datasets by at least 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively compared with other related methods.


- Implemented the algorithm of MAGET and evaluated the performance on two popular datasets, i.e., BoT-IoT and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The experiments show that MAGET possesses 94.3%/1.8% TPR/FPR and 99.8%/0.1% TPR/FPR in anomaly-based classification and 95.2% and 91.9% accuracy in signature-based classification, respectively.

**Unknown traffic identification algorithm without threshold**

**Role:** Group leader

* Responsible for drafting project applications and driving projects to successful completion.


- Proposed a threshold-free unknown traffic detection network for intrusion detection, which greatly 
  reduces performance consumption by improving the discriminator network structure, realizing 
  rejection of unknown classes and classification of known classes.

- Initiated ideas and implemented the algorithm, wrote a patent which has been published.
