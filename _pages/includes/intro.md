Welcome! I am currently a graduate student in Computer Technology at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/)). My primary research interests focus on **network traffic analysis** and **intrusion detection**, with a particular interest in **enhancing the robustness of intrusion detection models**. Specifically, I am exploring advanced techniques to address challenges such as **low-quality training data**, **imbalanced training data**, and **zero-day attack detection**.
